# Vibe Coding Guide for Everyone

With AI models getting a lot better at coding, vibe coding has been gaining serious traction. But I keep hearing the same concerns from people:

- Those without a technical background or coding experience are hesitant to get started or don't know where to begin
- Some have tried it but give up when projects get complex and they can't handle the complexity
- Others feel overwhelmed by all the different AI coding tools out there
- Many struggle with knowing how to effectively communicate with AI to get the results they want, even for experience programmers

I want to help address all of these issues. This guide is designed to help anyone start vibe coding and build better products. I believe AI should be democratizing technology, not gatekeeping it.

(While the original idea of vibe coding is having AI code without knowing what it does, but I want to take it a step further. I want to help people build better products, not just have AI code for them. So in this guide I use the term vibe coding to also mean AI-assisted coding.)

## Core Philosophy

*   **Hands-on Experience:** Focus on hands-on experience of AI coding, with practical tips and exmaples.
*   **Tool-Centric Practicality:** The tools are the gateway. Learning how to *use the tools effectively* is important.
*   **Empowerment:** The goal is to empower PMs/Designers/anyone to validate ideas, communicate better with engineers, and potentially build simple, functional prototypes or products.
*   **Iterative Learning:** Embrace experimentation and learn from AI's responses, refining your approach.

## Lessons

### Lesson 1: Welcome to Vibe Coding
[Link to Lesson 1](en/Lesson_1_Intro.md).

- This lesson introduced vibe coding and AI-assisted coding, why it matters to you, and what to expect for vibe coding and this course.
- If you don't know what vibe coding is and how it might help you, this lesson is for you.

### Lesson 2: Your AI Coding Toolbelt
[Link to Lesson 2](en/Lesson_2_Tools.md)

- This lesson explores the different AI coding tools available on the market, recommendations for tools and the recommended initial set up (models/MCP/rules).
- If you're unsure which tool to use, which models to choose for your AI coding tools, or need some tips on MCP and AI rules, this lesson is for you.

### Lesson 3: AI-Assisted Coding Workflow
[Link to Lesson 3](en/Lesson_3_Workflow.md)

- This lesson walks you through my recommended workflow of building app from scratch with AI.
- If you want to learn how to build a simple app from scratch with AI or want to make the AI-generated app more robust and maintainable, it's a recommended read.

### Lesson 4: Effective Prompting
[Link to Lesson 4](en/Lesson_4_Prompt.md)

- This lesson covers many important tips for effectively prompting AI coding tools for higher quality output.
- If you feel that your AI coding tool often don't understand what you say or don't produce expected code, make sure you read this.

### Lesson 5: Understanding Code
[Link to Lesson 5](en/Lesson_5_Code_Basics.md)

- This lesson teaches the basics of code, including frontend vs backend, how they communicate, and their basic building blocks.
- This lesson is useful if you don't know how to code/programming and need some primer of the baisc concepts to help you better communicate with AI coding tools.

### Lesson 6: Frontend Prompting
[Link to Lesson 6](en/Lesson_6_Frontend_Prompt.md)

- This lesson teaches you how to write effective prompts for developing frontend (focusing on UI and UX) with AI coding tools, including analysis of a good prompt and tips for prompting.
- This lesson is useful if you need to develop UI for your app.

## Disclosure About the Use of AI
I gather info and design the curriculum of this course. I wanted to share everything I learned along the way that I worked with AI coders in my own experience. For everything lesson, I write the main ideas & first drafts, but I rely on AI for fixing grammar mistakes & typos, and making edits to make this read better. So some sentences may read like AI to you, but the ideas were by myself.

## About the Author
I'm Troy Zhao, a product manager for my full-time job. But I do love to code some projects in my spare time. I also keep close track of AI progress. On [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/Troyanovsky), you may find some userful projects like [running local LLM](https://github.com/Troyanovsky/Local-LLM-Comparison-Colab-UI), [useful AI prompts](https://github.com/Troyanovsky/AI-Professional-Prompts), [autonomous agent tutorial](https://github.com/Troyanovsky/autonomous_agent_tutorial), and [projects that use AI](https://github.com/Troyanovsky/Building-with-GenAI). I also write about AI and product management on [Medium](https://medium.com/@guodong_zhao). I'm sure you'll find my content and projects useful.
