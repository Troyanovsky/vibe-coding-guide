# Vibe Coding Guide for Everyone 人人都能上手的 Vibe Coding 指南

With AI models getting a lot better at coding, vibe coding has been gaining serious traction. But I keep hearing the same concerns from people:

- Those without a technical background or coding experience are hesitant to get started or don't know where to begin
- Some have tried it but give up when projects get complex and they can't handle the complexity
- Others feel overwhelmed by all the different AI coding tools out there
- Many struggle with knowing how to effectively communicate with AI to get the results they want, even for experience programmers

I want to help address all of these issues. This guide is designed to help anyone start vibe coding and build better products. I believe AI should be democratizing technology, not gatekeeping it.

(While the original idea of vibe coding is having AI code without knowing what it does, but I want to take it a step further. I want to help people build better products, not just have AI code for them. So in this guide I use the term vibe coding to also mean AI-assisted coding.)

AI 模型在编程方面越来越出色了，Vibe Coding 氛围编程正受到越来越多的关注。但是这些情况还挺常见的：

- 没有技术背景或编程经验的人犹豫不知从何入手
- 有些人尝试过氛围编程，但当项目变得越来越复杂，他们无法处理时，就放弃了
- 还有人对市面上五花八门的 AI 编程工具感到不知所措，不知道怎么选择
- 许多人（甚至包括经验丰富的程序员）都在努力学习如何有效地与 AI 沟通以获得他们想要的结果

我希望能帮助解决这些问题。这个指南的目的是帮助任何人开始 Vibe Coding 并构建更好的产品。我相信 AI 应该让技术大众化，而不是设置更多的障碍。

（虽然 Vibe Coding 的初衷是让 AI 在你不知道它如何工作的情况下进行编程，但我想更进一步。我想帮助人们构建更好的产品，而不仅仅是让 AI 为他们编写代码。因此，在本指南中，我使用 Vibe Coding 一词也指代 AI 辅助编程 AI-assisted coding。）

## Core Philosophy 核心理念

*   **Hands-on Experience:** Focus on hands-on experience of AI coding, with practical tips and exmaples.
*   **Tool-Centric Practicality:** The tools are the gateway. Learning how to *use the tools effectively* is important.
*   **Empowerment:** The goal is to empower PMs/Designers/anyone to validate ideas, communicate better with engineers, and potentially build simple, functional prototypes or products.
*   **Iterative Learning:** Embrace experimentation and learn from AI's responses, refining your approach.

*   **动手实践：** 专注于 AI 编码的动手实践，提供实用的技巧和示例。
*   **工具为中心的实用性：** 工具是入门的途径。学习如何*有效使用工具*至关重要。
*   **赋能：** 目标是赋能产品经理/设计师/任何人，让他们能够验证想法，更好地与工程师沟通，并有能力构建简单的、功能性的原型或产品。
*   **迭代学习：** 拥抱实验，从 AI 的回应中学习，并不断完善你的使用方法。

## Disclosure About the Use of AI 关于使用 AI 的说明
I gather info and design the curriculum of this course. I wanted to share everything I learned along the way that I worked with AI coders in my own experience. For everything lesson, I write the main ideas & first drafts, but I rely on AI for fixing grammar mistakes & typos, making edits to make this read better, and translate them into Chinese. So some sentences may read like AI to you, but the ideas were by myself.

我自己搜集了氛围编程和 AI 辅助编程相关的信息，并设计了这个课程的教学大纲。其中有网络上大家分享的经验和我自己在使用 AI 编程中的个人体会和经验。对于每一节课，我会自己写下主要的内容和初稿，但是会用 AI 来修正语法错误和拼写错误，进行编辑以使文章更易读，并将它们翻译成中文（我更习惯用英文写作，我会人工再编辑一次 AI 翻译过的中文内容，保证它们是我想要传达的意思）。所以有些句子对你来说可能读起来像 AI 写的，但想法都是我自己的。
