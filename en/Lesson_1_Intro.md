## What is Vibe Coding & AI-Assisted Coding?

Let's start with what **Vibe Coding** is. The term was first posted by Andrej Karpathy (former OpenAI researcher and Tesla's AI director) on Twitter/X, and he describes it as coding where "you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists." Essentially, it's having AI write code without really knowing how it works yourself.

**AI-assisted coding**, on the other hand, is using generative AI tools to help you code while maintaining some understanding and control over what's happening.

Now here's the thing – pure vibe coding is absolutely magical when it works. You can build things you never thought possible, and it feels like having superpowers (which may be just an illusion). But it can easily get disastrous and frustrating when you want to build something bigger or more complex. You hit a wall, the AI starts making weird mistakes, and you have absolutely no idea what's going on and how to fix. **You're stuck.**

That's why I want this course to both approaches, but with a focus on making your code **more robust and reliable**. I don't want to see people try vibe coding, get stuck, and then rage quit thinking "AI can't do meaningful things." Because it absolutely can – you just need to know how to work with it. (I'm optimistic about AI, but I try to keep myself realistic.)

AI extends your ability, not replaces you. Think of it as a collaborative process between you and the AI, but you're still the driver. You're making the decisions about what to build and how it should work. Don't give in to it. You should be **in control**.

## Why This Matters for PMs/Designers/Non-Coders

Since I'm a product manager myself and have a lot of designer friends, I can really feel how using AI for coding can change the way we work.

**Rapid prototyping & idea validation** is probably the biggest game-changer. You can come up with a product idea or an interaction idea, describe it in natural language (even with voice input), and have a working demo in seconds/minutes instead of weeks. This means faster iterations and tangible demos you can put in front of users right away.

**Better communication** with your dev teams becomes so much easier when you can actually show them what you're thinking instead of just describing it in words or with static wireframes. You can demonstrate what you want to build and even show it to your boss or stakeholders. No more lost-in-translation moments.

You can also use AI coding for **quick technical feasibility checks**. I needed an iOS homescreen widget that could update a countdown ticking in seconds. Previously, we thought widgets could only be updated through timelines (which don't work at the second level). I quickly pulled up a SwiftUI project in Xcode and had ChatGPT create a working prototype. Turns out the widget itself could compute and update internally rather than relying solely on timelines. This five-minute experiment saved us from making the wrong technical decision.

**Getting small technical roadblocks out of the way** is another huge benefit. If you just need to change text copy, A/B test two simple pages for conversion, or make quick tweaks, you don't need to wait for dev resources. You can just do it yourself.

Plus, you'll **gradually learn programming concepts** while vibe coding, which helps you communicate better with developers and design better products overall. Of course, you need to reflect and learn ablong the way, instead of purely outsourcing your brain to AI.

## What to expect about AI coding

Let's be real here – AI is a powerful assistant, not a magic wand. You can't think of a huge, complex product and expect it to implement everything perfectly in one shot.

AI has real limitations you need to know about. It hallucinates sometimes, makes errors, and occasionally produces non-optimal or insecure code (spoiler alert: it does this quite often). It also has knowledge cut-off dates, so it might not know about the latest libraries, technologies, or APIs (like the not-so-user-friendly liquid glass from WWDC25, lol). But don't worry – there are solutions to all of these problems, and I'll teach you how to handle them in the upcoming lessons.

The key thing to remember is that the **"human-in-the-loop"** is essential. Your judgment, testing, and verification are what make this whole process work. You're not just blindly accepting whatever the AI spits out – you're actively collaborating with it.

One important note: be sure to check the policies of any AI tool you use. Look into whether they'll use your content or code for training, who owns the IP, and what their data retention policies are. Typically, AI coding tools with paid plans won't train on your data, but always double-check for yourself.

## Quick Preview of the Course

We're going to cover a lot of things together. You'll learn about the AI coding tools available right now and I'll make my personal recomnedations of when to use which one. I'll show you a workflow for producing reliable code and apps with AI, along with prompting skills that get you higher quality output.

There will also be a very brief primer of basic programming concepts that help you communicate better with both AI and developers. You'll see example prompts for frontend and backend development, learn how to build your own reusable library for AI coding tools, and learn testing and debugging with AI.

By the end of this course, you'll have all the pro-tips and strategies you need to build real, working products with AI – not just throwaway weekend toy projects, but stuff that actually matters for your work and ideas.
